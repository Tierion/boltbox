## Simnet Startup Script
### Quick Start

After cloning the project to the host where you want to run your simnet:

```
$ make simnet
```

The following will take down and remove all containers and volumes:
```
$ make burn
```

Checkout the README in the /simnet directory for more details on bootstrapping
your own simnet network for testing lightning.
